This course is an introduction to robotics from a computer scientistâ€™s perspective. While robotics is inherently broad and interdisciplinary, we will primarily focus on ideas with roots in computer science, as well as the roles that a computer scientist would play in a robotics research or engineering task. Topics include motion planning, state estimation, localization and mapping, kinematics, and robot learning.

## Course Objectives
- Identify and define some of the algorithmic problems that roboticists have to solve.
- Understand the challenges of interfacing algorithms with physical systems.
- Implement a variety of local, search-based, and sampling-based planning algorithms.
- Implement Kalman and Bayes filters for state estimation and localization.
- Use homogeneous transformations to model robot kinematics.
- Solve the forward, inverse, and differential kinematics problems for robot manipulators.
- Describe analytical and implement numerical solutions for inverse kinematics.
- Gain an awareness for learning-based approaches in robotics.
