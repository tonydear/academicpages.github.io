Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad, interdisciplinary, and fast-growing subfield of computer science concerned with the construction and deployment of intelligent agents. This course provides an overview of the methods and applications of AI, with a focus on algorithms and computation. Topics include search problems, constraint satisfaction, and games; sequential decision problems and reinforcement learning; hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, and probabilistic inference; supervised machine learning, decision trees, linear classification, and neural networks. Students will develop intuition and algorithmic thinking through written as well as programming problems in Python. By the end of the course, students will be able to build intelligent agents that can solve problems through search, make decisions and reason in the face of uncertainty, and learn simple models from data.

## Course Objectives
- Formulate search and constraint satisfaction problems and implement uninformed and informed search algorithms.
- Model games as adversarial search problems and implement efficient search algorithms to solve them.
- Model sequential decision problems as Markov decision processes and solve them using dynamic programming and reinforcement learning methods.
- Model temporal and spatial reasoning problems using hidden Markov models and implement inference and learning algorithms.
- Model probabilistic reasoning problems using Bayesian networks and implement inference, sampling, and learning methods.
- Implement and effectively use common supervised learning algorithms, including linear classification, logistic regression, and neural networks.

## Prerequisites
- Data Structures (COMS W3134 or COMS W3137)
- Familiarity with basic probability theory (discrete distributions, conditioning, Bayes' rule)
- Familiarity with basic linear algebra (vector and matrix operations)
